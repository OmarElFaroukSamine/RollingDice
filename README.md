This program is gonna be a little game of rolling a dice 5 times and checking if it's equal all times, 
It will have a visualisation of it using png images and graphics library probably (still haven't decided which methot to use).
It will also be asking the user if he wants to keep running it until it lands and gives you how many times it took for them to all be equal.
The purpose of this program is just trying to dive deeper into c++ and trying to create something with low level c++ instead of using an engine or something like that
